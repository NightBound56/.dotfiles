# PersonalDotFiles
Run set.sh after cloning.
This will:
1. install required packages
2. set up symlinks to required config files
3. create default folder directories
4. setup python virtual environments prod, dev, test

This repo will also copy across required scripts for aliases and automation.
Youtube-dl needs to be installed via pip AFTER the virtual environments are installed to avoid arch linux package manager conflicts.
Only install it in prod.
